# Cyber-Defence Campus

Cyber threats have substantially increased in recent years. To this end, the Cyber-Defence Campus (CYD Campus) was founded in January 2019 in order to anticipate cyber developments more quickly. It forms the link between DDPS, industry and science in research, development and training for cyber defence.
